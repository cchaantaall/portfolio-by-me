Hello my name is Chantal Koops and I try to learn code by myself. I live in the Netherlands and i am working as a customer service agent. 

I did multiple courses online, trying to get into web development. In a couple of years I learned some HTML, CSS, JS, GIT and a lot of side courses about web development.
I don''t feel like a beginner web developer, and still don't have a good idea what i'm going to do with my knowledge i've learned so far. 

So I started another course, and this is the portfolio repositery.
